This test verifies the binom.confint function from the binom package.

It checks the behavior of binom::binom.confint across the following methods:
"exact", "ac", "asymptotic", "wilson", "prop.test", "bayes", "logit", "cloglog",
and "probit".

For each method, the function is called with a variety of input triples
(x, n, conf.level). The output of "mean", "lower", "upper" is then compared to
expected results computed independently of the binom package.
